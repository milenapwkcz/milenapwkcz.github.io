# CV and cuisine generator pages

Hello everyone,

This repository contains two pages made by using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
First one can be found under [CV](https://milenapwkcz.github.io/CV/) hyperlink.
The second one can be found uner [Cusine Generator](https://milenapwkcz.github.io) hyperlink.

## CV

This page is created for the purpose of creating an example of CV. I did not contain the private information as it is confidential.

### Page content

The page contains a simple CV with the details about my current experience and abilities.

## Cusinie generator page

This page was fully done because of the indecisive nature of mine and my fiancÃ©'s. We love trying new things but when it comes to making a decision of what we should eat we usually pick the places we've already visited. This is fully **daily use** page, done by using the *HTML* and *Javascript* possibilities and its goal is to make our lives easier :)

### Page content 

The page is made in Polish and it only contains a header and the button. After clicking on the button, below there is a result of cuisinie we should eat with the small gif and the list of restaurants serving this cuisine in Cracow. 


> I like to make programs for daily decisions by using my abilities in order to help me with making decision. This is only an example of a simple page which we actually use
> when we want to go to the restaurant.
